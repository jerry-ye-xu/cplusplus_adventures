# C++ is so good!
Trying to learn C++ because I have decided not to take INFO3220...

To be honest, knowing C has made my life slightly easier. 

Feel free to browse around, I have just tried to implement some algorithms and data structures in C++ just to practice the language.

This is not meant to be anything serious.
